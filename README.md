# tidytransit

Use tidytransit to map transit stops and routes, calculate transit
frequencies, and validate transit feeds. tidytransit reads the [General Transit Feed Specification](http://gtfs.org/) into [tidyverse](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) and [simple features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features) dataframes.

## Installation

This package requires a working installation of
[sf](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf#installing).

A CRAN version is available:

``` r
install.packages('tidytransit')
```

For the development version from Github:

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("r-transit/tidytransit")
```

For some users, `sf` is impractical to install due to system level
dependencies. For these users,
[`trread`](https://github.com/r-transit/trread) may work better. It has
more limited functionality, but it can read GTFS tables into R.

# Usage
