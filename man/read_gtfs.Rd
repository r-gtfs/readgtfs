\title{Get and validate dataframes of General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data.}
\usage{
read_gtfs(path, local = FALSE, quiet = TRUE, frequency = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character. url link to zip file OR path to local zip file. if to local path, then option \code{local} must be set to TRUE.}

\item{local}{Boolean. If the paths are searching locally or not. Default is FALSE (that is, urls).}

\item{quiet}{Boolean. Whether to see file download progress and files extract. FALSE by default.}

\item{frequency}{Boolean. Whether to add frequency/headway calculations to the gtfs object}
}
\value{
A GTFS object. That is, a list of dataframes of GTFS data.
}
\description{
This function reads GTFS text files from a local or remote zip file.
It also validates the files against the GTFS specification by file, requirement status, and column name
The data are returned as a list of dataframes and a validation object,
